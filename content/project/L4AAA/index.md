The Landmarks for Available Avatar Animations (L4AAA) Open Dataset is a publicly available database designed to assist developers in addressing the issue of limited datasets for 3D animation synthesis.

Accurate manual 3D annotation is a difficult task that requires either a well-equipped laboratory with 3D scans or the construction of a synthetic dataset, both of which come with their own challenges.
