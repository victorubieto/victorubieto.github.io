abstract: Animating avatars for sign languages (SLs) is a challenging task due to
  the high quality and naturalness requirements. Recent publications and media show
  that virtual avatar quality is evolving, yet remain greatly constrained by the predefined
  set of animations available, crafted by skillful animators. In this research, we
  propose two different but complementary systems, focusing on sign animations synthesis
  and scalability. The first uses Behaviour Markup Language (BML) to drive the avatar
  procedurally from textual instructions, derived from HamNoSys, SiGML and the Facial
  Action Coding System (FACS). Several techniques are employed for driving the avatar
  such as geometric inverse kinematics and blendshape weight modulation. The second
  system resorts on widespread low-end technology such as webcams to generate 3D animations
  from simple video by applying different Machine Learning (ML) techniques. In our
  implementation, both systems are coupled with an editor for tweaking the resulting
  3D animations. It also provides a point-and-click interface for generating BMLs
  through sliders and boxes that can be greatly adjusted in time and duration. Hence,
  users can generate new content adapted to their circumstances without the need of
  specialised equipment or knowledge.
