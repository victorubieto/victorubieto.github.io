abstract: Natural language processing and the machine translation of spoken language
  (speech/text) has benefitted from significant scientific research and development
  in recent times, rapidly advancing the field. On the other hand, computational processing
  and modelling of signed language has unfortunately not garnered nearly as much interest,
  with sign languages generally being excluded from modern language technologies.
  Many deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals use sign language on a daily basis as
  their first language. For the estimated 72 million deaf people in the world, the
  exclusion of sign languages from modern natural language processing and machine
  translation technology, aggravates further the communication barrier that already
  exists for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. This research leverages a linguistically
  informed approach to the processing and modelling of signed language. We outline
  current challenges for sign language machine translation from both a linguistic
  and a technical prespective. We provide an account of our work in progress in the
  development of sign language lexicon entries and sign language lexeme repository
  entries for SLMT. We leverage Role and Reference Grammar together with the Sign_A
  computational framework within this development. We provide an XML description for
  Sign_A, which is utilised to document SL lexicon entries together with SL lexeme
  repository entries. This XML description is also lev-eraged in the development of
  an extension to Bahavioural Markup Language, which will be used within this development
  to link the divide between the sign language lexicon and the avatar animation interface.
